SpectraFitting
==============

Mathematica tools for quick and easy fitting of lines in spectra. Designed initially to fit lorentzians to nanocavity transmission spectra.

The bulk of the code is in the mathematica package SpectraFitting.m.

To see an example, download the whole project (including the example data) and open example.nb. Make sure that the first line has the correct path to SpectraFitting.m.

The package also has some powerful tools for fitting XPS spectra. Two example files are included with many demonstrations.

The rest of the usage notes can be found in the example notebooks.
