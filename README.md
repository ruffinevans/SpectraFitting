SpectraFitting
==============

Mathematica tools for quick and easy fitting of lines in spectra. Designed initially to fit lorentzians to nanocavity transmission spectra.

The bulk of the code is in the mathematica package SpectraFitting.m.

To see an example, download the whole project (including the example data) and open example.nb. Make sure that the first line has the correct path to SpectraFitting.m. By default, it will use the link to the master version online, so it should work out-of-the box.

You also need to make sure that you have the correct path to the example data.

The rest of the usage notes can be found in the example notebook.
